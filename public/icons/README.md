# Icons

Place the following icon files here:

- icon16.png (16x16)
- icon48.png (48x48)
- icon128.png (128x128)

Use the WA Boost logo/branding for the icons.

For now, you can use placeholder icons or generate them using a tool like:
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- Or create simple icons with Figma/Photoshop

The icons should have a WhatsApp-related theme (green color scheme).
